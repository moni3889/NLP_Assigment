The aim of this project has been to analyse the reviews written by the customers of different hotels. This reviews were written in the webpage trivago and the link where this data are is the following:
https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/trip-advisor-hotel-reviews
Making a study of these reviews we can obtain information about the most repeated words and with it a slight idea of the topics that are most often discussed when evaluating a stay in a hotel. In addition, another objective of this project was to develop a model capable of classifying reviews according to whether they are positive or negative. This was done by building four models and comparing the results obtained.

This project has two R files, one for the analysis of the reviews and one for the predictions. When running it, it is convenient to set the working directory in the folder where the project with the data is located in order to avoid errors. To execute it, simply open the file and set the working directory in order to run the code.
